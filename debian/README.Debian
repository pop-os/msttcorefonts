DEFOMA
------

Msttcorefonts uses the DEbian FOnt MAnager (defoma). If you wish to
use the fonts provided by this package under the X Window System,
you must configure it to use defoma fonts.

The easiest way to do so is to use the x-ttcidfont-conf package.
For more information, install the x-ttcidfont-conf package and consult
its documentation under /usr/share/doc/x-ttcidfont-conf.

For uses of msttcorefonts not related to the X Window System
(e.g. printing) this is not required.
