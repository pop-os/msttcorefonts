msttcorefonts (3.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Thijs Kinkhorst ]
  * Update download URLs to use https. Depend on ca-certificates
    to make this work out of the box.
    (Closes: #910483, #912956, #958781)
  * Update font cache and restore SELinux context after installing
    the fonts (thanks Laurent Bigonville, Closes: #820627, #899373).
  * Checked for policy 4.5.0, no changes required.

msttcorefonts (3.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Print message that fonts are moved upon package removal
    (closes: #737630).
  * Remove any leftover defoma handling, since defoma has been
    removed in 2011.
  * Update to dh(1) sequencer, debhelper 11 and policy 4.1.3.
  * Switch to source format 3.0 (native).
  * Take some changes from Ubuntu diff. (Most of it we cannot
    use since it depends on update-notifier, which is not
    necessarily available in Debian.)

msttcorefonts (3.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Mark Multi-Arch: foreign, thanks Scott Ritchie, Daniel Hartwig
    (closes: #700684).
  * Switch to debhelper 9. Update for policy 3.9.4 (no changes).
  * Use maintscript support in dh_installdeb rather than writing out
    dpkg-maintscript-helper commands by hand.  We now simply Pre-Depend on a
    new enough version of dpkg rather than using 'dpkg-maintscript-helper
    supports' guards, leading to more predictable behaviour on upgrades.
    Thanks Colin Watson (closes: #659724).
  * Proxy test failed when HTTP:// is given in uppercase. Thanks
    Tobias Olsson (LP: #1072580).
  * Show licence message when fonts actually installed (closes: #672259).

msttcorefonts (3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use SF.net redirection instead of individual mirror names, as to be
    more robust against changes on the SF.net side.
  * Verify font and cab validity with SHA256 instead of MD5 for safety.
  * Verify downloaded cab files before extracting.
  * Remove obsolete transitional package 'msttcorefonts'.
  * Added Belarusian debconf translation, thanks Pavel Piatruk
    (closes: #516246).
  * Update to debhelper level 7 and other packaging cleanups, rename some
    more backend items from msttcorefonts to ttf-mscorefonts-installer.

 -- Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Jan 2009 20:55:45 +0100

msttcorefonts (2.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rename package to ttf-mscorefonts-installer.
    This is in line with all other TrueType fonts in Debian and makes
    it clear that the package doesn't actually include the fonts but
    is a downloader package (Closes: #286154).
  * Move ttf-liberation to Recommends and advertise it more prominently,
    now that it is in Debian main.

 -- Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>  Mon, 07 Jul 2008 22:22:28 +0200

msttcorefonts (2.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move defoma debconf template to README. Not having defoma configured but
    requiring it is getting rare, so debconf is overkill.
  * Checked for policy 3.8.0, updated debian/copyright. Add Lintian
    override for emtpy fonts dir. Updated to debhelper 6. Drop version
    specification for debconf for pre-etch debconf version.
  * Suggest ttf-liberation, not available from Debian yet but is available
    to users of debian-multimedia.
  * Drop preinst script that was only present to clean up for unstable/testing
    users that installed 2.0 - we've given them a year and it shouldn't
    pollute stable.
  * Remove set -e from prerm, because if msttcorefonts is not properly
    installed defoma-font may fail and we're still well uninstalled.
    (Closes: #461926)
  * Update mirror list.

 -- Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>  Sat, 14 Jun 2008 16:36:00 +0200

msttcorefonts (2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix typo in templates, unfuzzy translations.
  * Add Finnish translation by Esko Arajärvi (closes: #448957).

    thanks Sven Joachim (closes: #438989, #425322).

 -- Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Nov 2007 21:06:18 +0100

msttcorefonts (2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Aliases to the defoma hints file for Arial (Helvetica),
    Courier New (Courier) and Times New Roman (Times) variants.
    Thanks Angus Lees for the pointer (Closes: #393746).
  * Added Vietnamese translation by Clytie Siddall (Closes: #427179).
  * Updated Danish translation by Kenneth Nielsen.

 -- Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Aug 2007 08:01:01 +0200

msttcorefonts (2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move debhelper defoma code down in postinst, so any script failures
    will happen before the fonts are registered.
  * Also deregister the removed Tahoma with defoma (Closes: #425228).

 -- Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>  Sun, 20 May 2007 15:35:37 +0200

msttcorefonts (2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop Tahoma font introduced in 2.0. Since it lacks a bold counterpart,
    it causes more trouble than it solves (Closes: #424852, #424864).
  * Add --no-directories and --no-background options to wget to
    override those when set by the user (Closes: #422535).
  * Remove obsolete upgrading code.

 -- Thijs Kinkhorst <thijs@debian.org>  Sat, 19 May 2007 11:58:30 +0200

msttcorefonts (2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * No longer install the update-ms-fonts command. It's only
    needed upon package installation/upgrade, so it's now part
    of the package postinst. In the rare case that it needs to
    be ran again, just dpkg-reconfigure (Closes: #401698).
  * Add new font: Tahoma. Based on patch from Michael Gilbert,
    thanks! This unfortunately nearly doubles the download size
    (Closes: #380294).
  * Add support for setting a HTTP proxy during installation.
    Unfortunately it turns out to be difficult to pass the
    http_proxy environment variable around properly between
    different shells, especially for those using sudo, so
    this is needed for some situations
    (Closes: #333012, #413646).
  * Update to debhelper compatibility level 5 (from 1).
  * Remove obsolete upgrading code causing warnings
    (Closes: #290856, #392544, #405658).
  * Checked for policy 3.7.2, no changes.
  * X config location is now xorg.conf, not XF86Config-4.
  * Fix some non-POSIX shell code (Closes: #354926).
  * Refactor debconf prompting: drop template 'blurb'
    as per policy 3.9.1 (no copyright messages in debconf),
    make baddldir of type error and some minor corrections
    (Closes: #388936).
  * Update the list of SF.net mirrors.

    Openoffice.org also seems to be happy with this. In addition, this should
