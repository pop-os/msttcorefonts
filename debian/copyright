This package is not part of the Debian GNU/Linux system but located in
the contrib section. This is because it's not functional in and of itself
but depends on downloading the fonts which are not under a free licence.

Please read the READ_ME!.gz file in /usr/share/doc/msttcorefonts for
licensing terms for the fonts themselves.
