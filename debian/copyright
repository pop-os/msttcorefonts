This package is not part of the Debian GNU/Linux system but located in
the contrib section. This is because it's not functional in and of itself
but depends on downloading the fonts which are not under a free licence.

For licensing terms for the fonts themselves, please read the READ_ME!.gz
file located (after download) in /usr/share/doc/ttf-mscorefonts-installer
